       "\"Ash Ketchum – trainer of Pallet Town, winner of the Orange League and increasingly close runner up in five other regional tournaments – was... confused.He was floating in black, empty nothingness. No light, no sound, nothing to use as a reference point – and, at first, he wasn't sure how he'd ended up there.When he tried to remember, instead of the most recent moments he found something strange happening. His mind went straight back to the earliest moments he could remember – flicking past at astonishing speed, as though his whole life were flashing before his eyes on fast forward.A few things stood out, as though he was slowing down to think about them more clearly.The first time he saw a Pokémon, at barely two years of age, when Professor Oak – taking care of him when Ash's mother was shopping - was called away suddenly and Ash, Gary and Daisy were left under the supervision of his distinguished old Arcanine, a gentle Pokémon, but a terror in battle decades before when Samuel Oak was the League Champion.Only reviewing this long forgotten past now did Ash truly realize that he had felt things differently. Other people, he knew, would feel the heat running under the Fire Pokémon's fur. But few would feel the surging, volcanic power in Arcanine's breast just from being near – faintly, but still somehow there to be felt.Ash hadn't mentioned it at the time, or later. He simply assumed that was what people felt. But now, he was older – and made a connection which suddenly seemed obvious.Aura, he thought. I can feel his Aura. The gentle amusement, the tiny little part of its mind always on the ready for danger. It's just like that Riolu back in Sinnoh... and Lucario.The memory dissolved, and his life played itself out again, perhaps a little slower than before.The time he was five, at Cinnabar island on the black sand beaches, and a snatch of haunting song floated through the air.I know that music… Ash realized. But how? What would Lugia have been doing this far north of\""
